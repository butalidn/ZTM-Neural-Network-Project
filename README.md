# ZTM-Neural-Network-Project

This project is from following Zero to Mastery's ML and DS Bootcamp in the Neural Networks section

It was originally done in Google Colab. Goes through the workflow of working with TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

Over 10,000 images and dog breed labels were turned into Tensors. The images were preprocessed and batches were created.A Keras model was created using a MobileNetV2 layer. The model was trained to identify dog breeds based on images.
